The error "Dei Rahuleeeeeee and with the context [object Object]" indicates a problem with how you're handling data, specifically that you're trying to display an object directly instead of its properties.  The "[object Object]" is JavaScript's default string representation of a generic object.  "Dei Rahuleeeeeee" is likely some unrelated text that's being printed alongside this object representation.

To fix this, you need to access the specific *properties* within the object rather than the object itself.  Here's how, assuming a few scenarios:

**Scenario 1: The object has a property you want to display.**

Let's say your object looks like this:

```javascript
const myObject = { message: "Hello, world!", name: "Dei Rahuleeeeeee" };
```

The incorrect way (resulting in the error):

```javascript
console.log("Dei Rahuleeeeeee and with the context", myObject); // Outputs "Dei Rahuleeeeeee and with the context [object Object]"
```

The correct way:

```javascript
console.log("Dei Rahuleeeeeee and with the context", myObject.message); // Outputs "Dei Rahuleeeeeee and with the context Hello, world!"
console.log("Name:", myObject.name); // Outputs "Name: Dei Rahuleeeeeee"
```

**Scenario 2: The object is nested.**

If your object is nested, you need to access the properties using dot notation (`.`) or bracket notation (`[]`) repeatedly:

```javascript
const nestedObject = { data: { message: "Another message", user: { name: "Dei" } } };

console.log("Nested message:", nestedObject.data.message); //Outputs "Nested message: Another message"
console.log("Nested name:", nestedObject.data.user.name); //Outputs "Nested name: Dei"
```

**Scenario 3:  You need to stringify the object for debugging.**

If you need to see the entire contents of the object for debugging purposes, use `JSON.stringify()`:

```javascript
console.log("Object contents:", JSON.stringify(myObject, null, 2)); // Outputs a formatted JSON representation of the object
```
The `null, 2` arguments pretty-print the JSON for readability.

**Scenario 4:  The object is undefined or null.**

If `myObject` might be `null` or `undefined`, you need to check for that before trying to access its properties:

```javascript
const myObject = null; // or undefined

if (myObject) {
  console.log(myObject.message);
} else {
  console.log("The object is null or undefined");
}
```

**To fix your specific issue:**

You need to provide the code snippet where you're encountering this error.  Then, I can give you a more precise solution based on how you are creating and using the object causing the problem.  Include the code that creates `myObject` and the line that prints it.  Knowing the context will allow for a more helpful response.
