The infinite loop is in the JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
for(let i=0;i>5;i++){ 
  console.log(i); 
}
```

The condition `i > 5` is initially false (0 is not greater than 5).  Therefore, the loop body never executes, and the loop terminates immediately, not infinitely.  There's no infinite loop here.  The problem statement is incorrect about this part.


The Python code:

```python
for i in range(1,):
    print("poda dei")
```

This *does* create an infinite loop. `range(1,)` is equivalent to `range(1, infinity)`.  To fix it, you need an upper bound:

```python
for i in range(1, 10):  # Example upper bound of 10.  Change as needed.
    print("poda dei")
```


The Java code is correct and doesn't have any issues. It performs a linear search correctly for both 1D and 2D arrays.


In summary:  The only actual infinite loop is in the Python code.  The JavaScript code, as written, is not an infinite loop.  The Java code is fine.
