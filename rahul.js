The phrase "[object Object]" usually indicates that you're trying to print or log a JavaScript object without properly specifying what property you want to access.  A linear search within that context means you're searching *within* the properties of that object.

There's no single "fix" without seeing the code.  To help me fix your linear search, please provide the code snippet.

However, I can offer general advice on optimizing linear searches within JavaScript objects and how to avoid the "[object Object]" issue:

**Optimizing Linear Search in JavaScript Objects:**

1. **Check for Property Existence:** Before attempting a linear search, check if the property you're searching within even exists.  This avoids unnecessary iterations.  Use `hasOwnProperty()` for reliable property checks:

   ```javascript
   const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
   const searchKey = 'b';

   if (myObject.hasOwnProperty(searchKey)) {
       console.log("Key found:", myObject[searchKey]);
   } else {
       console.log("Key not found");
   }
   ```

2. **Use `Object.keys()` or `Object.values()`:** If you need to search across *all* keys or values, use `Object.keys()` or `Object.values()` to get arrays of keys or values respectively. This allows you to use more efficient array search methods if appropriate (though it might still be a linear search depending on the method):


   ```javascript
   const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
   const searchValue = 2;

   const values = Object.values(myObject);
   const index = values.indexOf(searchValue);

   if (index !== -1) {
       console.log("Value found at index:", index); //Index refers to the position within the array of values, not the object key.
   } else {
       console.log("Value not found");
   }
   ```

3. **Consider Data Structures:** If you're doing many searches, a linear search might be inefficient. Consider using a different data structure better suited for searching, such as a `Map` (for key-value pairs) or a `Set` (for unique values).  Maps offer O(1) average-case lookup time.

   ```javascript
   const myMap = new Map([['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]]);
   console.log(myMap.get('b')); // O(1) lookup
   ```

**Avoiding "[object Object]":**

The "[object Object]" error happens when you try to `console.log()` or stringify an object directly without specifying which property you want.  Always access the specific property you need:

   ```javascript
   const myObject = { name: "John Doe", age: 30 };
   console.log(myObject.name); // Correct: Logs "John Doe"
   console.log(myObject);       // Incorrect: Logs "[object Object]"
   console.log(JSON.stringify(myObject)); // Correct: Logs a JSON string representation of the object
   ```

**Example: Fixing a Linear Search**

Let's say you have this code causing the problem:

```javascript
const myObject = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" };
const searchTerm = "New York";

for (let key in myObject) {
    if (myObject[key] === searchTerm) {
        console.log("Found:", myObject); // Problem: Logs "[object Object]"
    }
}
```

The fix is simple:

```javascript
const myObject = { name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York" };
const searchTerm = "New York";

for (let key in myObject) {
    if (myObject[key] === searchTerm) {
        console.log("Found:", key); // Correct: Logs "city"
        break; //Exit the loop once found.
    }
}
```

Provide your code, and I can give you a more specific and tailored solution.
