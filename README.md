# Project Overview

This project contains a collection of files demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques.  The files include:

* **TextFile.txt:** Contains sample text data.
* **File1.java:** A simple Java class with an addition method.
* **File2.java:** A Java class that utilizes File1's addition method.
* **Mani.java:** A Java class implementing a square root calculation.
* **rahul.js:** A JavaScript snippet (contains a bug).
* **aStar.js:** A JavaScript implementation of the A* search algorithm.
* **Omen.py:** A Python script checking if a number is prime (contains a bug).
* **Searching/LinearSearch.java:** A Java class implementing linear search for 1D and 2D arrays.


## File Descriptions:

* **TextFile.txt**: This file holds example text for demonstration purposes. The content is Lorem ipsum text.
* **File1.java**: This Java file defines a class with a simple method that adds two integers.
* **File2.java**: This Java file demonstrates the usage of the `File1` class.
* **Mani.java**: This Java file shows a custom implementation for calculating the square root of a number using binary search and iterative refinement. 
* **rahul.js**:  This JavaScript file has a `for` loop that will not execute correctly due to an incorrect condition.
* **aStar.js**: This JavaScript file contains an A* search algorithm implementation. This is a common graph traversal algorithm used in pathfinding and other applications that require finding the shortest path.
* **Omen.py**: This Python script attempts to determine if a given number is prime. It has a bug in its primality test.
* **Searching/LinearSearch.java**: This Java file contains implementations for performing linear searches on 1D and 2D arrays. It returns either the index of the target element or -1 if the element is not found.
