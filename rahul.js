You did not provide the `rahul.js` code.  To fix an infinite loop in a `for` loop, we need to see the code.  The error message "for loop is running infinite times in rahul.js and with the context [object Object]" suggests the loop's termination condition is always true, likely because of a problem with how a variable is being updated within the loop.

Here are the common causes of infinite `for` loops and how to fix them:

**1. Incorrect loop condition:**

* **Problem:** The condition in the `for` loop's middle part (`condition`) never becomes false.  This is the most frequent cause.

* **Example (incorrect):**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  // ... some code that doesn't modify 'i' ...
} // i is always less than or equal to 10, so the loop never ends.

for (let i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {
    //i is always greater than or equal to 0, loop will never end
}
```

* **Solution:** Ensure that the loop variable is updated within the loop body in a way that eventually makes the condition false.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  // ... some code that might modify i  ...  //Example: i+=2
  console.log(i);
}

for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

**2. Unintentional modification of the loop counter:**

* **Problem:**  Something inside the loop accidentally changes the loop counter variable (`i` in most cases), preventing it from reaching the termination condition.

* **Example (incorrect):**

```javascript
let i = 0;
for (; i < 10; i++) {
  i = 0; // Resets i to 0 in every iteration!
  console.log(i);
}
```

* **Solution:**  Carefully review the code inside the loop to ensure nothing is inadvertently resetting or modifying the loop counter.


**3.  Issues with array iteration and length:**

* **Problem:** Iterating through an array, but modifying the array's length within the loop.  This can lead to skipping elements or an infinite loop.

* **Example (incorrect):**

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  arr.push(6); //Adding to the array changes the length during iteration
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

* **Solution:** Create a copy of the array or iterate in reverse if you need to modify the array during iteration. Or use array methods like `forEach` or `map` that are less prone to these issues.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arrLength = arr.length; //Store the length before looping
for (let i = 0; i < arrLength; i++) {
  arr.push(6);
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

//Better approach using forEach (no length issues)
arr.forEach(item => {
    console.log(item)
    //Modify the array here if needed
});
```

**4.  Logical error in the condition:**

* **Problem:** A mistake in the conditional expression that makes the loop condition always true due to a typo or wrong comparison.


**To get help, please provide the code in `rahul.js`.**  I can then pinpoint the exact problem and offer a specific solution.  Also, mentioning the relevant part of the code where the `for` loop is located will help.
