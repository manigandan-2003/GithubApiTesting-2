# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install and run the project locally:

## Prerequisites

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed.
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed (if the project is a Node.js project).

## Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory that was created when you cloned the repository.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    If the project has any dependencies, you need to install them.  For a Node.js project, run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or, if you use yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    If the project uses a different package manager or has other specific installation instructions, follow those instructions instead.

4.  **Run the application:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application.  For a Node.js project, this might involve running a command like:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    Refer to the project's documentation or `package.json` file for the correct command to start the application.

## Additional Information

*   Include information on environment variables, configuration files, or any other setup steps required to run the application correctly.
*   Document any specific versions of software required.
*   Describe the project structure.
