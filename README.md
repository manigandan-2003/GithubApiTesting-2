# Project Overview

This project contains a collection of files demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques.  The included files showcase different programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Python) and algorithms (A*, linear search). 

## File Descriptions

* **TextFile.txt:** Contains sample text.
* **File1.java:** A simple Java class with an `add` method.
* **File2.java:** A Java class that uses `File1`.
* **Mani.java:** A Java class demonstrating a square root approximation algorithm.
* **rahul.js:** A JavaScript snippet with a loop (containing a logic error).
* **aStar.js:** A JavaScript implementation of the A* search algorithm.
* **Omen.py:** A Python script to check if a number is prime (with a logic error).
* **Searching/LinearSearch.java:** A Java class implementing linear search for 1D and 2D arrays.

## Usage

Each file can be executed independently. The Java files require a Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run. The JavaScript files can be executed using a Node.js environment. The Python file can be run using a Python interpreter.

## Notes

* Some of the files contain logic errors that may need correction.
* The project structure and code are intended to demonstrate various programming concepts and not for any specific practical application.
