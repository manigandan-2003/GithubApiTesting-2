# Gemini API Integration for Automated Code Fixes

This repository demonstrates the integration of the Gemini API for automated code fixes.  Currently, the API is used to process text files (like `Summa-2.txt`).  Future development will include support for other file types.

## File Processing

The following files are currently processed:

* `Summa-2.txt`

## Future Enhancements

* Support for more file types (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.java`)
* More sophisticated code analysis and error detection
* Integration with other code analysis tools
* Improved error handling and reporting

## Usage

1. Install required libraries (if any)
2. Run the main script (to be developed)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.
