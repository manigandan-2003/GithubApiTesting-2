Please provide the code in `rahul.js` that's causing the infinite loop.  I need to see the code to help you fix it.  Without the code, I can only offer general advice about common causes of infinite loops in JavaScript:

* **Missing or incorrect termination condition in a `while` or `for` loop:**  The most common cause.  Make sure your loop has a condition that will eventually become `false`, allowing the loop to exit.  Double-check your increment/decrement logic.

* **Incorrect recursive function:**  A recursive function calls itself. If it lacks a base case (a condition that stops the recursion), it will run forever.

* **Unintentional modification of loop variables:**  If a loop variable is modified unexpectedly within the loop body (e.g., accidentally resetting the counter), the loop might never terminate.

* **Logic errors:**  Sometimes the logic of your loop is flawed, preventing the termination condition from ever being met.  Carefully trace your code's execution to identify the problem.


Once you provide the `rahul.js` code, I can give you a specific solution.
