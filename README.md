# Project Overview

This project contains various files demonstrating different programming concepts and techniques.  The included files showcase examples in Java, JavaScript, and Python.

**File Descriptions:**

* **File1.java:** Contains a simple `add` function that adds two integers.
* **File2.java:** Demonstrates the use of the `File1` class by calling the `add` function.
* **Mani.java:** Implements a function to calculate the square root of a number using a binary search approach and then refines it to a certain number of decimal places.
* **rahul.js:** Contains a JavaScript loop (currently has a logic error; the loop condition `i > 5` will never execute).
* **aStar.js:** Implements the A* search algorithm (currently only the heuristic function and a placeholder for the main algorithm are provided).
* **Omen.py:** Checks if a given number is prime.
* **Searching/LinearSearch.java:** Implements linear search for both 1D and 2D arrays.
* **TextFile.txt:** Contains several lines of Latin text.
