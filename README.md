# Project Overview

This project contains a collection of files demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques.  The included files showcase examples in Java, JavaScript, and Python.

**File Descriptions:**

* **TextFile.txt:** Contains sample text for demonstration purposes.
* **File1.java:** A simple Java class with an addition method.
* **File2.java:** A Java class demonstrating the use of `File1.java`.
* **Mani.java:** A Java class implementing an approximate square root calculation.
* **rahul.js:** A JavaScript file with a (currently incorrect) loop.
* **aStar.js:** A JavaScript file containing a placeholder for an A* pathfinding algorithm implementation.
* **Omen.py:** A Python script checking if a number is prime (with an error).
* **Searching/LinearSearch.java:** A Java class implementing linear search for both 1D and 2D arrays.

**Further Development Notes:**

* The `rahul.js` file contains a loop with an incorrect condition. It should be modified to perform as intended.
* The `aStar.js` file currently only includes a heuristic function. A full A* implementation is needed to make it functional. 
* The `Omen.py` script has a logical error. The prime check needs correction.  Specifically, it uses `n/i == 0` instead of the modulo operator `%`.
