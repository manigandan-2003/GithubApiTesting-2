# Project Overview

This project contains several files demonstrating various programming concepts and algorithms.  The files include:

* **TextFile.txt:** Contains sample text.
* **File1.java:** Contains a simple class with an addition method.
* **File2.java:** Demonstrates usage of the `File1` class.
* **Mani.java:** Implements an approximation of the square root function.
* **rahul.js:** Contains a flawed JavaScript loop.
* **aStar.js:** Implements the A* search algorithm.
* **Omen.py:** Checks if a number is prime (contains an error in logic).
* **Searching/LinearSearch.java:** Implements linear search for 1D and 2D arrays.

## File Descriptions

**TextFile.txt:** This file serves as a placeholder for text data.

**File1.java:**  A simple Java class with a method `add` that adds two integers.

**File2.java:**  A Java class that uses the `add` method from `File1.java`.

**Mani.java:** A Java class that provides an approximate square root calculation using an iterative approach.

**rahul.js:** A JavaScript file that demonstrates a loop with a condition that will never allow the loop to execute.

**aStar.js:** A JavaScript implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.  The heuristic function is an example and may need adjustment depending on the specific problem.

**Omen.py:** A Python script attempting to check if a number is prime.  It contains a logical error in its prime check.

**Searching/LinearSearch.java:** A Java class that demonstrates linear search for elements in both 1D and 2D integer arrays.

## Usage

Each file can be run or compiled independently, depending on the programming language. Refer to each file's comments for further instructions.
