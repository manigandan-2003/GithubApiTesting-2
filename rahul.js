The error "summa and with the context [object Object]" indicates that you're likely using a JavaScript library (probably related to summarization or text processing) incorrectly.  The `[object Object]` part shows that you're passing an object where the library expects a string (the text you want to summarize).

To fix this, you need to identify **which property** of your object contains the text you want to summarize.  Let's assume your object is called `myObject` and the text is stored in a property called `text`.  Here's how you'd adjust your code:


**Example using hypothetical summarization library:**

```javascript
// Assuming 'myObject' contains the text you want to summarize
const myObject = {
  text: "This is a long string that needs to be summarized.  It contains lots of information about various topics.",
  otherData: "This is some irrelevant data"
};

//Incorrect usage - passing the whole object
//let summary = myLibrary.summarize(myObject); // This will cause the error


//Correct usage - passing the text property
let summary = myLibrary.summarize(myObject.text); 

console.log(summary); 
```

**Specific library adjustments:**

The exact solution depends on the library you are using (e.g., `sumy`, a Python library, won't work directly in JavaScript).  You'll need to consult the library's documentation to understand how to correctly pass the text for summarization.


**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Identify the library:**  What library are you using for summarization? Knowing this is crucial.

2. **Inspect `myObject`:** Use `console.log(myObject)` to see the exact contents of the object you are passing. This will show you what properties it has and what data they hold.

3. **Correct the input:** Based on step 2, extract the relevant text string from `myObject` and pass *only that string* to the summarization function.

4. **Check library documentation:** Look up the correct input format for the summarization function in the library's documentation.


**Example with a more detailed hypothetical library (illustrative):**

```javascript
// Hypothetical summarization library with options
const summarizer = {
  summarize: function(text, options = {}) {
    if (typeof text !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Text must be a string');
    }
    // ... summarization logic ...
    return "This is a summarized version of the input text.";
  }
};

const myObject = {
  title: "My Document",
  content: "This is a long piece of text that needs to be summarized. It contains many sentences.",
  date: "2024-10-27"
};

try {
  const summary = summarizer.summarize(myObject.content, { length: 50 }); // using the content property and options
  console.log(summary);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error.message);
}

```

Remember to replace placeholders like `myLibrary` and `myObject` with your actual variable names and adjust the code according to your specific library and data structure.  Provide the name of the library you are using for a more tailored answer.
