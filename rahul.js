The error message "Error in Astra.py" and the subsequent Latin text are completely unrelated.  The Latin is just filler text and provides no information about the actual error in your `Astra.py` file.

To fix the issue, I need to see the *code* in `Astra.py` and the *specific error message* you're getting (including the traceback, if any).  The error message likely includes a line number and a description of what went wrong.  For example, a common error message might look like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Astra.py", line 10, in <module>
    my_variable = some_function(x)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

This tells us that on line 10 of `Astra.py`, there's a problem adding an integer and a string.

**Please provide:**

1. **The code of your `Astra.py` file.**
2. **The complete and exact error message you are receiving.**  Copy and paste it directly.
3. **The context of the error:** What were you trying to do when the error occurred?  What inputs were you using?


Once you provide this information, I can help you debug your code.
