```javascript
//There's no issue to fix.  "who is rahul" is not JavaScript code.  
//To make it executable, you would need to provide context, for example:

//If you want to store "Rahul" in a variable:
let rahul = "a person";


//If you want to log "Who is Rahul?" to the console:
console.log("Who is Rahul?"); 

//If you are looking for information about a person named Rahul, you will need to provide a database or other data source.

```
