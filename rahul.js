You haven't provided the `rahul.js` code.  To fix an infinite loop in a `for` loop, we need to see the code.  However, I can give you the common causes and how to fix them:

**Common Causes of Infinite `for` Loops:**

1. **Incorrect Initialization:** The loop variable might not be initialized correctly, or it might be initialized in a way that prevents the loop condition from ever becoming false.

2. **Incorrect Condition:** The condition in the `for` loop might always evaluate to `true`.  This is the most frequent cause.

3. **Incorrect Increment/Decrement:** The increment (or decrement) part of the `for` loop might be missing or incorrect, preventing the loop variable from ever reaching the value that would make the condition false.

4. **Modification within the loop:**  If you modify the loop counter *inside* the loop body in a way that prevents it from reaching the termination condition, you'll get an infinite loop.


**Example of an Infinite Loop and its Fix:**

**Infinite Loop:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

This loop is infinite because `i` starts at 0 and is always greater than or equal to 0, no matter how many times it's incremented.

**Fixed Loop:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

This loop will run 10 times and then terminate.


**To help me fix your `rahul.js` code, please provide the code itself.**  Also, tell me what the loop is *intended* to do.  Knowing the purpose will help me understand what's gone wrong.

The "[object Object]" context suggests you might be using an object as a loop counter, which is almost certainly incorrect for a numerical `for` loop.  It's likely that the error is in how you're setting up or using the loop variable.
