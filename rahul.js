```python
# Assuming the error is related to a missing or incorrect import
# and that 'Astra' refers to a class or module

try:
    from some_module import Astra # Replace 'some_module' with the actual module name
except ImportError:
    print("Error: Could not import Astra. Please ensure that the necessary module is installed and in your PYTHONPATH.")


# Or, if the error is related to a specific method or attribute
# within the Astra class:

try:
    astra_instance = Astra() # Replace with your Astra instantiation
    astra_instance.some_method() # Replace with the problematic method
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}. Check the Astra class definition.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```
