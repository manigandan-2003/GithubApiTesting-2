The problem is that you haven't provided the code!  To fix the infinite loop, I need to see the code.  The error message "[object Object]" usually indicates that you're trying to use an object where a primitive value (like a number or string) is expected, often within a loop condition.

Here are some common causes of infinite loops and how to fix them, along with examples demonstrating how the "[object Object]" error might arise:

**1. Incorrect Loop Condition:**

* **Problem:** The loop condition never becomes false.  This often happens when a counter isn't incremented properly or a comparison is flawed.

* **Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
let obj = { count: 0 };  //Problematic object as loop condition

for (; obj; obj.count++) { //obj will always evaluate to true (truthy)
  console.log("Infinite loop!"); 
}
```

* **Solution:** Use a proper numerical counter or a condition that will eventually evaluate to `false`.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

//Or using the object correctly
for (let i = 0; i < obj.count; i++){
  console.log(i);
}

//Or modifying the object to terminate the loop
for (let i = 0; obj.count < 10; i++){
  console.log(i);
  obj.count++;
}
```

**2. Modifying the Loop Variable Incorrectly:**

* **Problem:**  Inside the loop, you unintentionally modify the variable used in the loop condition in a way that prevents the condition from ever becoming false.


* **Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
let i = 0;
for (; i < 10;) {
  i = i + 0.1; // Floating-point inaccuracies can lead to an infinite loop
  console.log(i);
}
```

* **Solution:** Use integer increments or carefully manage floating-point comparisons, using a tolerance for equality.


**3. Incorrect Object Property Access:**

* **Problem:** You're using the object itself as a loop condition, or trying to access a property that doesn't exist, leading to unexpected behavior and infinite loops.

* **Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
let myObj = { data: [1, 2, 3] };

for (let i = 0; i < myObj.length; i++) { // myObj doesn't have a length property
  console.log(myObj.data[i]);
}
```

* **Solution:** Access properties correctly. In this example, use `myObj.data.length`.

```javascript
let myObj = { data: [1, 2, 3] };

for (let i = 0; i < myObj.data.length; i++) {
  console.log(myObj.data[i]);
}
```


**4.  Asynchronous Operations:**

* **Problem:** If your loop contains asynchronous operations (like `setTimeout` or AJAX calls), the loop condition might be checked before the asynchronous operation completes, leading to unexpected behavior.

* **Solution:** Use promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations correctly within loops.


**To get a helpful answer, please provide the following:**

1. **The code snippet:**  The complete code where the infinite loop occurs.
2. **The programming language:**  (e.g., JavaScript, Python, C++, Java)
3. **The context:** What is the purpose of this loop? What are you trying to achieve?


With this information, I can provide a much more accurate and helpful solution.
