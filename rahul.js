```python
# Assuming the error is related to a missing or incorrect import 
# and that 'Astra' refers to a class or module.  This is a guess 
# without seeing the original code.  Replace 'YourAstraModule' with 
# the actual name of your module or class.

from YourAstraModule import Astra

# ... rest of your code using the Astra class or module ...
